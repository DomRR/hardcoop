With 'special' ;) thanks to the authors of the l4d2_autoIS plugin, all credits to them for their code:
- New plugin [specialspawner.smx] to replace [special_infected_wave_spawner.smx]
	- SI spawn in groups of configurable size, up to an 'SI limit'
	- 'SI limit' cvar that can be overriden with Admin only 'SI limit Server cap' cvar 
	- SI class limits and spawn weights that affect spawn probability; spawns will vary a lot more 
	- !limit, !weight, !timer cmds for all users
	- hold your "USE" and "RELOAD" keys to read limits and other customisation settings off the Spawner HUD; fades after 1s
- Added witch spawning functionality to coopbosses
	- see sourcecode for cvars

Added new vanilla cvar settings to improve AI thanks to this addon: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=732341797
