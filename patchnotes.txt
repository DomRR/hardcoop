Updated folder structure to remove the need to replicate updates across multiple configs
- config specific settings should now to be placed in the relevant confogl.cfg and gauntlet/gauntlette(num) .cfgs
- moved repeated cvars and plugin loads into shared_cvars.cfg, shared_settings.cfg and shared_plugins.cfg
- config is now AceMod based, inc. strippers
- removed "in the hood" config as since SI limit settings now carry across maps, hunters only configs can be manually set for the campaign

Confoglcompmod
- removed extra spaces from .cfg that were preventing many confoglcompmod features from working

Added 1p and 3p configs
- 1p config uses hunter 1v1 plugin to auto clear players when capped by hunter/jockey
- lower dmg per successful SI pounce on a player
- 10dmg/pounce
hardcoop_reminder.smx
- added this plugin to print command names to survivors periodically

Balancing: increased the frequency of spawns, but granted survivors more tools to survive
- confoglcompmod pills limit now works and has been increased to 2 * num survivors
- alternatively survivors can be granted a second set of pills at a map percentage customisable with sm_pillpercent/!pillpercent [pillsonly.smx]
	- default 50%
- decreased common limits in all configs inc horde limits for finite events

QoL
- compromised the moving and static spreads of SMGs between vanilla and AceMod 4.0 values
- removed spitters from default configs due to the high potential of SI stacking on one player
- finale starting kits are now converted into pills
- extra time(default 5s/player) extension is now applied to wave interval per incapped player at end of interval

l4d2_meleeinthesaferoom.smx
- added 2 melee in the saferoom for all configs

[AI_HardSI.smx]
- collapsed all the AI plugins (except ai_targeting.smx) into a single modular plugin similar to confoglcompmod.smx
- streamlines expensive OnPlayerRunCmd() callbacks into one plugin rather than four
- Tanks
	- added tank bhop option (disabled by default); cvar: 'ai_tank_bhop'
- Hunters
	- hunter pounce angle mean from 20 to 10
	- hunter pounce angle std deviation from 20
	- if locked on a target, will straight pounce if survivor is not looking near them (default 30 degrees)
	- blocked hunter scratches as they dealt 10 damage and were not cvar'able
- Chargers
	- will take into account its own health, distance to survivor and whether they their target is looking near them on the horizontal plane
- Jockeys
	- pounce ability will now be put on cooldown when used as was intended

Optimisation cvars:
- [special_infected_wave_spawner]
	- siws_spawn_attempt_interval
		- Interval between SI spawn attempts. Increase interval to reduce server load
		- default 0.5
- [AI_HardSI.smx]		
	-ai_assault_reminder_interval
		- "Frequency(sec) at which the 'nb_assault' command is fired to make SI attack
		- default 2

[special_infected_wave_spawner.smx]
- !limit max now controls a server SI limit('siws_maxlimit') available only admins (default 15)
- 'siws_max_specials' removed
- limits printout formatting has been adjusted for readability

[coopbosses.smx]
- created !toggletank command to toggle spawning of a flow tank

added [pause.smx]
- fixed infinite bleeping loop ocurring upon unpause 
- recompiled to account for bot spectators
- added IsFakeClient() check for line 356: 'SendConVarValue(client, sv_noclipduringpause, "1");'

- pillsonly to pillsupply
- survivor_reset to resetsurvivorkits
- replaced autowipe with AutoSlayer
